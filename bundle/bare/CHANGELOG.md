# Changelog

Versioning rules for the suite itself:
- **Major:** any change that can move scores, i.e. new or removed benchmarks, changed anchors, caps, weights, targets or maturity rules. Scores from different major versions are **not comparable**. `gradekit diff` won't treat their deltas as regressions.
- **Minor:** clarified wording that shouldn't move scores, new optional fields, new tool commands. Re-run calibration to confirm.
- **Patch:** typos, formatting, documentation.

After any major or minor change, re-run calibration (`calibration/README.md`) before trusting new scores.

## 4.0.0
Weights changed, so scores are **not comparable** with 3.x.
- **Everything tunable is now config:** `config/defaults.toml` (commented), layered with an optional org config and a per-project `project.toml`. Replaces `rubric/weights.json`; the benchmark list moved to `rubric/catalog.json`.
- **Weights from questions instead of fixed profile columns:** eight questions about the project (data sensitivity, audience, lifespan, failure impact, team, change rate, delivery, scale) adjust base weights. Presets supply typical answers; overrides need a written reason. `gradekit resolve --explain` shows the reasoning behind each weight.
- **Gates:** Correctness and Security always, plus benchmarks added by answers (e.g. handling money makes Idempotence and Durability gates). A failed gate caps the overall score; maturity levels set gate minimums (replacing "Pillar A minimum").
- **Criticality zones:** hot, normal and cold code. Findings get an effective severity shifted by zone. Maturity levels limit open findings by effective severity and zone, and hot-zone work ranks first.
- **Ranked priorities** computed by `gradekit rollup` (tiers, then weight × gain × zone ÷ effort), instead of being ranked by the grader.
- **New commands:** `init`, `resolve`, `presets`. Every command that scores takes `--config`. Reports record the config hash, and `validate` rejects a report checked against a different config.
- **Report changes:** `config` block replaces `profile` / `target_mode` / `target_overrides`; `config_weight` replaces `profile_weight`; findings may carry `paths`.
- Requires Python 3.11+ (built-in TOML reader).
- New `TUNING.md` and `config/project.example.toml`; `rubric/weights.md` now explains how scoring works.

## 3.1.0
- **Web version:** `tools/build_web.py` generates a static site you can host on any web server. It has a landing page, an `AGENT.md` entry point agents can be pointed at, rendered docs, raw files, a downloadable zip, and `manifest.json` / `SHA256SUMS` for checking downloads. See `DEPLOY.md`.
- Optional `run.suite_source` field records where the suite came from.
- No scoring changes: scores remain comparable with 3.0.0.

## 3.0.0
- Split into a kit: grader, improver and pull-request prompts; one rubric file per pillar; canonical `weights.json`; JSON Schema; `gradekit.py`.
- **Integrity and safety rules:** repo content is evidence, never instruction; attempts to influence the grader become integrity flags that cap maturity at L1; grading runs sandboxed.
- **Independence and hidden checks:** a fresh grader for every run, hidden checks kept from improvers, redacted shared reports, and divergence detection.
- **Metrics block:** raw measurements recorded alongside scores.
- **Calibration:** reference repos with expected scores; stability across runs via median consensus, with unstable benchmarks flagged.
- **Targets:** proportional, maximal or level-based, with per-benchmark overrides, replacing "10 everywhere".
- **Findings:** stable IDs, statuses, and human dispositions.
- **Evidence:** exact-quote code citations, checked by `verify-evidence`; absence evidence.
- **Actions:** `requires_human_decision` with a decision question.
- **Pull-request quick mode** with a pass/fail verdict.
- **Monorepo support** via per-component reports and `rollup-repo`.

## 2.0.0
- Expanded to 29 core benchmarks in 6 pillars plus conditional benchmarks; added "Not this" boundaries, profile weights and the maturity ladder; added applicability (`full`, `limited`, `not_applicable`) and weight notes.

## 1.0.0
- First version: 15 core benchmarks and 4 conditional ones in a single prompt.
